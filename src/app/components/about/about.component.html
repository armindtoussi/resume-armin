        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>My short term goal is to continue increasing my proficiency with Angular 4
           and Android mobile development. I have also been working a lot with 
           Firebase and Firestore on recent work projects and it would be nice 
           to boost my knowledge with these databases as well.
        </p>
        <p>My long term plan is to develop augmented aeality apps on mobile, 
           and potentially on any future hardware that hits the market. I also 
           have a passion for education and would like perhaps merge the two worlds
           of AR and education into one. 
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for taking the time to look at my website, feel free to email me 
           or download a copy of my resume as I am always on the lookout for exciting 
           job opportunities.
